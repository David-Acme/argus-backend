# argus-llm — CONTEXT

## Why the llm service exists

F4-5 of the `migracion-microservicios` plan extracts the LLM engine out of
the legacy monolith (Rulings BS-BV). `argus-llm` is a sibling service with
its own binary, own CMake preset and zero HTTP exposure. Unlike the VLM
(F4-4), this is NOT a capacity-only move: the voice session is a real
consumer, so the cutover re-points the voice session's `IVoiceLlm` seam to
this service over the internal wire while the legacy keeps its in-process
`LlmService` boot-initialized for MemoryService (see the dual state below).
It mirrors the argus-tts (F4-2), argus-stt (F4-3) and argus-vlm (F4-4)
scaffolds.

## What it owns

- **The chat engine** (shared-tree `LlmService`, compiled into this binary
  via the PORTED pattern): LiquidAI LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct
  (`models/llm/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-QAD-Q4_0.gguf`) through llama.cpp
  (vendored `third_party/llama.cpp`, tag b10305; the same commit the legacy
  links — NO mtmd: chat only). Boot aborts if the engine fails to load.
  `LlmService` is owned BY VALUE by the controller (the adapter shape — no
  singleton) and takes `ai_init::llamaMutex()` exactly as the legacy
  llm-service.cc does; `argus-llm`'s main owns its own
  `llama_backend_init/free` with the legacy teardown order (tear the engine
  down BEFORE freeing the backend — skipping the ordered teardown segfaults
  in `llama_backend_free`).
- **The KV-prefix cache (`cachedTokens_`) stays IN the service** —
  per-process warm state. One llama context, one cache slot: concurrent
  sessions with different prompts THRASH the cache exactly as two voice
  sessions did in-process (the legacy semantics are unchanged, not fixed);
  alternating different prompts reuse 0 tokens each time. The
  `GET /llm/v1/config` leg exposes the last prefill stats so the thrash is
  observable.
- **The internal wire (Ruling BT)**:
  - `POST /llm/v1/chat` — JSON `{messages, max_tokens?, temperature?,
    reset_context?}` → frozen app-envelope with `info.text` = the full
    completion. Inference runs off the event loop (`chatAsync`).
  - `POST /llm/v1/chat-stream` — same body; `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
    text stream: every token callback flushed AS PRODUCED (arrival order
    preserved — the voice session's sentence chunker depends on it),
    terminated by a final JSON sentinel line `\n{done:true,
    prompt_tokens, reused_tokens, decoded_tokens}\n`. The sentinel is the
    client's exact end-of-stream marker; token framing is "chunks until the
    sentinel line". Generation runs on a producer thread (the TTS stream
    pattern), the engine mutex serializes concurrent generations.
  - `GET /llm/v1/config` — `{loaded, defaultMaxTokens, defaultTemperature,
    contextSize, lastPromptTokens, lastReusedTokens, lastDecodedTokens}`
    (additive, internal-only).
  - Errors, all in the frozen envelope: 400 `BAD_REQUEST` (non-JSON body),
    422 VALIDATION_ERROR (empty/oversized messages, out-of-range
    max_tokens/temperature — `fields` keyed by the C++ member names, the
    documented DSL quirk), 503 `LLM_NOT_LOADED`, frozen 404/405. Latency
    logged per request.
- **Config**: `[llm]` (engine knobs, mirroring the legacy block) +
  `[server]` (loopback listener, default 7032) only. No database, no NATS,
  no JWT/device keys — nothing here persists anything.

## Tier note (the F4-2 lesson, applied)

The service compiles `hardware-profile.cc` with `ARGUS_NO_NCNN_GPU=1`, so
its capability tier is derived WITHOUT the Vulkan probe and
`HardwareProbe::llmGpuLayers()` resolves CPU-only. When the legacy offloads
to GPU, pin the parity value with `[llm] gpu_layers` (999) in this
service's config — `LlmService::init` reads the same override the legacy
reads.

## The dual state (Ruling BU/BF) — legacy side

`llm.remote_url` in the legacy `[llm]` block re-points ONLY the voice
session (`RemoteVoiceLlm` behind the F4-1 `IVoiceLlm` seam). The legacy
`LlmService` STAYS boot-initialized either way: `MemoryService`'s
`isBusy()` polling and `chat()` are same-process calls against the
in-process singleton (the back-pressure signal), and that redesign is
argus-memory's (F4-6), not this task's. The boot log shows both lines:
"LLM delegated to <url> for the voice session" AND "LLM loaded: …". There
is no in-process fallback once remote is configured — a down argus-llm
surfaces as an exception inside the voice turn's existing error path (the
turn degrades, the worker survives), while memory workers keep running
untouched.

## What it did NOT change

- The app móvil never talks to this service; no gateway routing, no new
  app-facing contract; voice frames stay byte-identical.
- No tool loop: `LfmAdapter`/`ToolRegistry`/`chatWithTools` stay legacy-side
  (Ruling BV) — this service exposes chat/chat-stream only.
- Model artifacts stay in the shared `models/llm/` tree — never copied.
- The legacy `LlmService` stays linked and initialized in the legacy binary
  (Ruling BF); the symbol proof for the legacy is unchanged by this task.

## Compose volume

The docker compose must mount the shared `models/` tree (at least
`models/llm`) into this service's working directory — the engine reads the
GGUF relative to the `[llm]` config keys.
